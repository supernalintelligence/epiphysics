## Introduction

Epimechanics is a framework that models everything — physical systems, biological organisms, economies, minds — as self-representing causal structures. It rests on seven foundational definitions. This document shows that when those definitions are quotiented by three declared equivalences, the resulting dependency graph converges to a four-node fixed point whose spectral radius is $\varphi = (1+\sqrt{5})/2$, the golden ratio. The first two equivalences formalize co-primitive pairings; the third ($E \cong R$) is a well-motivated postulate. The golden ratio is a structural consequence of this definitional architecture — real, but specific to the graph it produces.

---

## The Seven Definitions

Epimechanics defines seven primitive concepts, organized into three groups:

| Group | Definitions | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Co-primitive pair 1 | **Causation** (C), **Entity** (E) | Ontological ground: what exists and what connects |
| Bridge | **State** (S) | The inaccessible referent that representations approximate |
| Co-primitive pair 2 | **Computation** (Co), **Representation** (R) | Epistemological ground: how approximations are produced |
| Derived pair | **Information** (I), **Prediction** (P) | Evaluative: how good the approximation is, and what it implies |

Each definition in one sentence:

- **Causation**: the relation by which one entity's state constrains another's.
- **Entity**: anything with causal presence; equivalently, anything representable.
- **State**: what determines an entity's causal dispositions; the posited referent that representations approximate.
- **Computation**: producing a representation — discriminating, partitioning, compressing.
- **Representation**: the product of computation; an approximation of state.
- **Information**: predictive information — the degree to which a representation's distinctions reduce uncertainty about future states, above background noise.
- **Prediction**: reduction of uncertainty about future states given a representation's information content.

These definitions form a directed graph with **7 nodes and 17 edges** (entry $M_{ij} = 1$ when definition $i$ references definition $j$). The adjacency matrix is:

$$A_7 = \begin{pmatrix} & C & E & S & \text{Co} & R & I & P \\ C & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ E & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ S & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ \text{Co} & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ R & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ I & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ P & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$

The graph is **strongly connected** with **diameter 5**. Every definition is reachable from every other. The spectral radius of $A_7$ is $\approx 2.247$.

## The Three Equivalences

Three equivalences are declared among these definitions:

**1. Causation $\cong$ Entity** (co-definitional). Causation is defined as what connects entities; entities are defined as what causation connects. Neither is prior. They are two descriptions of a single primitive.

**2. Computation $\cong$ Representation** (co-definitional). Computation is the process of producing a representation; a representation is the product of computation. Again, neither is prior.

**3. Entity $\cong$ Representation** (well-motivated postulate). If something has causal presence, it can — at least in principle — be represented, because detecting its causal effects produces a distinction. If something can be represented, it has causal presence, because representation is a causal interaction.

$E \cong R$ is a well-motivated postulate — hard to deny for entities we can interact with, fruitful in its consequences, but not logically necessary. Dark matter has causal presence detectable only through bulk effects: we can name our ignorance but cannot construct a structural representation. Whether "barely representable" is sufficient for the equivalence is a substantive question. The golden ratio follows from this postulate. If the postulate is wrong, the spectral radius stays at $2.247$.

## The Quotient Cascade

Quotienting by $X \cong Y$ means: merge $X$ and $Y$ into a single node $[XY]$, taking the union of their edges.

### Step 1: $C \cong E$

Merge C and E into $[\text{CE}]$. The graph reduces from 7 to **6 nodes**: $\{[\text{CE}], S, \text{Co}, R, I, P\}$.

$$A_6 = \begin{pmatrix} & [\text{CE}] & S & \text{Co} & R & I & P \\ [\text{CE}] & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ S & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ \text{Co} & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ R & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ I & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ P & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$

The self-loop at $[\text{CE}]$ arises because C $\to$ E and E $\to$ C both exist. Spectral radius: $\approx 2.247$.

### Step 2: $\text{Co} \cong R$

Merge Co and R into $[\text{CoR}]$. The graph reduces to **5 nodes**: $\{[\text{CE}], S, [\text{CoR}], I, P\}$.

$$A_5 = \begin{pmatrix} & [\text{CoR}] & [\text{CE}] & S & I & P \\ [\text{CoR}] & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ [\text{CE}] & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ S & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ I & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ P & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$

The self-loop at $[\text{CoR}]$ arises because Co $\to$ R and R $\to$ Co both exist. Spectral radius: $\approx 2.247$.

### Step 3: $E \cong R$

Since E lives in $[\text{CE}]$ and R lives in $[\text{CoR}]$, this equivalence forces $[\text{CE}] \cong [\text{CoR}]$. Merge them into a single node $\Phi$. The graph reduces to **4 nodes**: $\{\Phi, S, I, P\}$.

No further quotienting is possible. The cascade has reached a **fixed point**.

---

## The Fixed-Point Graph

The converged adjacency matrix is:

$$A_\star = \begin{pmatrix} & \Phi & S & I & P \\ \Phi & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ S & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ I & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ P & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$

The four nodes and their interpretations:

- **$\Phi$** — the fused causal-representational primitive, unifying causation, entity, computation, and representation. It is self-referential ($\Phi \to \Phi$) because representing requires entities which require causation which requires entities.
- **$S$** — *state*. The inaccessible referent that $\Phi$ approximates. $S \neq \Phi$ because representation is not reality.
- **$I$** — *information*. How well the representation approximates the state.
- **$P$** — *prediction*. Using information to constrain expectations about future states.

---

## Spectral Analysis

The characteristic polynomial of $A_\star$ is:

$$\det(A_\star - \lambda \mathbf{1}) = \lambda^4 - \lambda^3 - 2\lambda^2 + \lambda + 1 = 0$$

This factors cleanly:

$$(\lambda^2 - \lambda - 1)(\lambda^2 - 1) = 0$$

The four eigenvalues are:

| Eigenvalue | Approximate value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| $\varphi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ | $1.618$ | $\Phi \leftrightarrow S$ subblock |
| $1$ | $1.000$ | $I \leftrightarrow P$ interaction |
| $-1$ | $-1.000$ | $I \leftrightarrow P$ interaction |
| $-1/\varphi = \frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}$ | $-0.618$ | $\Phi \leftrightarrow S$ subblock |

**Spectral radius**: $\rho(A_\star) = \varphi \approx 1.618$.

**Determinant**: $\det(A_\star) = \varphi \cdot 1 \cdot (-1) \cdot (-1/\varphi) = 1$. The mapping preserves volume.

**Trace**: $\text{tr}(A_\star) = 1$. Only $\Phi$ is self-referential among the four nodes.

### Why the golden ratio?

The $\Phi \leftrightarrow S$ subblock is:

$$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$

This is the Fibonacci matrix (Graham, Knuth, Patashnik, *Concrete Mathematics*, 1994). Its characteristic polynomial is $\lambda^2 - \lambda - 1 = 0$, whose positive root is $\varphi$. The golden ratio appears whenever the next state depends on both the current state and the previous one: self-referential growth with memory depth 2.

The spectral radius of a static adjacency matrix governs **walk counts** (length-$k$ walks grow as $\varphi^k$), not dynamical growth. A dynamical interpretation requires treating the definitional system as iterated self-application, which is open work.

## The $E \cong R$ Equivalence as Spectral Taming

The three equivalences do not contribute equally to the convergence.

| Stage | Nodes | Spectral radius |
|---|---|---|
| Original graph | 7 | $2.247$ |
| After $C \cong E$ | 6 | $2.247$ |
| After $\text{Co} \cong R$ | 5 | $2.247$ |
| After $E \cong R$ | 4 | $\varphi \approx 1.618$ |

The first two equivalences leave the spectral radius unchanged. The third — $E \cong R$ — drops it to $\varphi$, a $28\%$ reduction. This taming is a structural consequence of this definitional architecture.

### Robustness

The result depends on the specific 17 edges of $A_7$. Flipping a single edge generically changes the eigenvalues.

The golden ratio survives if the $\Phi \leftrightarrow S$ subblock $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ is preserved — which requires that $\Phi$ has a self-loop (a self-referential primitive) and $\Phi \leftrightarrow S$ is bidirectional (representation approximates state, state constrains representation).

These two structural features — self-referential primitive plus bidirectional bridge — are arguably the core architecture, not an encoding choice. But this argument should be formalized before claiming universality.

---

## Interpretation

The converged graph tells a four-part story:

1. **The growing mode** ($|\lambda| = \varphi$): The $\Phi \leftrightarrow S$ cycle dominates walk counts ($\sim \varphi^k$ for length-$k$ walks). Whether this governs dynamical growth requires a dynamical formulation, which remains open.

2. **The persistent mode** ($|\lambda| = 1$): The $I \leftrightarrow P$ pair neither grows nor decays, forming a stable evaluative scaffold. Connects to [self-multiplication](./self_multiplication.md), where entities are eigenvectors with $|\lambda| = 1$.

3. **The decaying mode** ($|\lambda| = 1/\varphi \approx 0.618$): Non-self-referential structure is transient in walk-count terms.

4. **Volume preservation** ($\det = 1$): The definitional system as a whole neither creates nor destroys information. Growth in one mode is exactly compensated by decay in another.

[!sidenote] **Parallel to second quantization.** The co-primitive structure resembles QFT's algebraic structure (entities as states, causation as operators). The spectral structure suggests an algebraic constraint on $\Phi \leftrightarrow S$ involving $\varphi$, but the precise form is open.

## Open Questions

1. **Is there an algebraic constraint?** The Fibonacci matrix governs the $\Phi \leftrightarrow S$ subblock. Is there a deeper algebraic relation (analogous to $[a, a^\dagger] = 1$) from which this matrix can be derived rather than read off?

2. **Does the golden ratio constrain dynamics?** The spectral radius $\varphi$ governs walk counts on the definitional graph. Does it also constrain the dynamics of specific systems modeled within Epimechanics — for instance, bounding auto-causal density growth rates? This requires a dynamical formulation.

3. **Is the fixed point unique?** The quotient cascade reaches a 4-node graph that admits no further quotienting. Is this the unique fixed point for any sequence of valid equivalences on the original 7-node graph, or are there alternative equivalence declarations that lead to different fixed points with different spectral properties?

4. **Is the golden ratio robust to reasonable variations in the dependency encoding?** The Robustness section identifies the $\Phi \leftrightarrow S$ subblock as critical, but a systematic sensitivity analysis is needed.
