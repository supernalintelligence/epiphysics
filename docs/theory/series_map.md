## What's Genuinely Open

> **Scope note:** The three items below are open problems for the *physics foundation papers* (spacetime, quantum, loop-phase) specifically. The broader framework has nine open questions — see [Part 5: Ontology and Open Questions](./05_ontology_and_open_questions.md) for the full list.

Only three items remain unresolved in the physics papers:

| Open item | Why it matters | Path to closure |
|---|---|---|
| **Number=volume conjecture** | Fixes the conformal factor in the Lorentzian metric | Active research in causal set theory; numerical evidence strong |
| **Dimensionality n_s=3** | Explains why we observe 3+1 | Observer-selection argument is rigorous and grounded (Tangherlini + knot topology); needs formal statement as conjecture, not theorem |
| **Born rule via Gorard** | Connects multiway structure to probability | Either verify Gorard 2020 independently, or use Sorkin's discrete path measure as an alternative route |

Everything else in the framework is either proved, postulated explicitly, or defined at the appropriate layer.

## Development History

> This section records significant structural changes to the framework. Dated entries reflect work sessions. See individual documents for current proof status.

### 2026-03-25

For those tracking the framework's development — the following gaps identified in the AUDIT were resolved in today's work session:

| Issue | Resolution |
|---|---|
| P2 hidden assumption | Added Causal Dependency Axiom (CD) explicitly |
| Imaginary phase underspecified | Three-argument approach: Sorkin grade-2 + loop-phase + Wick rotation |
| Energy/action circularity | Layer separation: U(1) at Event Layer, S/ℏ identification at Observable Layer |
| ℏ circular (Planck time) | Redefined τ_min = 1/\|C_ref\| — event count ratio, no ℏ involved |
| Conjecture 4.2 (loop connectivity) | Proved for CSS cause-plexes (Theorem 4.4); counterexample found for general case |
| Critical-events rerouting (Step 3) | Proved via L1/L2/L3 sub-lemmas in step3_lemma.md |
| Phase-action identification | Proved as Proposition 6.2 (definitional identification at Observable Layer) |
| Stable Observer Manifold called "Theorem" | Downgraded to "Conjecture" with honest status |
| Missing Tangherlini reference | Added to spacetime paper references |
| Halliwell & Yearsley wrong journal | Fixed: PRD 86 (2012) not PRA 87 (2013) |
| Gorard not labeled as preprint | Labeled conditional in Theorem 4.2 |
| No CST relationship section | Added §8 to spacetime paper |
| Layer architecture not visible | Added Layer notes to spacetime and quantum papers |
| CI_min undefined | Defined via knot topology threshold |
| No self-grounding graph | Added Mermaid graph to spacetime paper + this document |
