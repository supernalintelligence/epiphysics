> **Series status:** This paper contains valuable research — including the causal-void counterexample to unrestricted loop-space connectedness and the conditional CSS connectivity theorem — but is no longer the primary route to $G = \mathrm{U}(1)$ in the Epimechanics series. The clean derivation is now in [Compositional Fixed-Point Derivation of the Amplitude Phase Group](./amplitude-phase-fixed-point-paper.md). The present paper provides corroborating routes (A and B) and documents the research trajectory. It is retained as a working paper, not a primary series entry.

## Abstract

We analyze when loop amplitudes in the multiway cause-plex must take the form $e^{i\phi}$. The result is split into three parts: (i) stability of iterated loops forces $|w|=1$; (ii) causal continuity plus loop-space connectivity forces connected image in the unit sphere; (iii) division-algebra minimality plus local tomography constraints select $\mathbb{C}$ and hence $\mathrm{U}(1)$. We include the full Step 3 rerouting argument inside this document and incorporate counterexample analysis: full unconstrained loop-space connectedness is false in general (causal-void annulus), while the restricted CSS theorem is the physically relevant statement.

Status labels used throughout are exactly:
- ✅ **Proved**
- ⚠️ **Conditional** (proved under a named explicit assumption)
- ❌ **Conjecture**

## 1. Introduction

Standard path-integral quantum mechanics uses $e^{iS/\hbar}$ as a postulate. This paper asks which amplitude group is forced by loop structure in a multiway causal substrate.

We keep a strict distinction:
- Event Layer structural claim: $w(\gamma)\in\mathrm{U}(1)$
- Observable Layer physical naming claim: $\phi(\gamma)=S[\gamma]/\hbar$

---

## 2. Definitions and Setup

**Definition 2.1 (Causal event).** A causal event (*state couplet*) $e$ is an ordered pair $(\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{in}}, \mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{out}})$ where $\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{out}}$ is determined by $\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{in}}$. No physical content is assumed.

**Definition 2.2 (Cause-plex).** The cause-plex $\mathcal{C} = (E, \prec)$ is a locally finite strict partial order.

**Definition 2.3 (Multiway cause-plex).**
$$\mathcal{C}^*(\mathcal{S}_0) = \{(E_\alpha, \prec_\alpha) : \text{locally finite strict partial order consistent with } \mathcal{S}_0\}$$

**Definition 2.4 (Branch graph).** The branch graph $\mathcal{B}$ connects adjacent histories differing by one covering-relation change.

**Definition 2.5 (Causal loop).**
$$\gamma = (e_0 \prec e_1 \prec \cdots \prec e_n = e_0')$$
with $e_0'$ in the same local state as $e_0$.

**Definition 2.6 (Loop space).** $\Omega(\mathcal{C}^*, e_*)$ is the set of all based closed loops.

**Definition 2.7 (Loop concatenation).** $\gamma_1\cdot\gamma_2$ is traversal of $\gamma_1$ then $\gamma_2$.

**Definition 2.8 (Amplitude assignment).**
$$w: \Omega(\mathcal{C}^*, e_*) \to G,\quad w(\gamma_1 \cdot \gamma_2)=w(\gamma_1)\cdot w(\gamma_2).$$

**Definition 2.9 (Probability measure).**
$$P(\mathcal{S}_f) = \left|\sum_{\gamma: e_* \to \mathcal{S}_f} w(\gamma)\right|^2 \cdot \mu$$
with $P\ge 0$ and $\sum_f P=1$.

**Definition 2.10 (Auto-causal density $\rho_{\mathrm{ac}}$).** Density of stable recurring loops with $|w(\gamma)|=1$.

---

## 3. Part 1: Stability Forces $|w| = 1$

**Proposition 3.1 — ✅ Proved.** If loops iterate stably, then $|w(\gamma)|=1$.

**Proof.**
$$w(\gamma^n)=w(\gamma)^n.$$
If $|w(\gamma)|>1$, amplitudes diverge; if $|w(\gamma)|<1$, they collapse to zero. Either contradicts stable persistence. Hence $|w(\gamma)|=1$. $\square$

**Corollary 3.2 — ✅ Proved.** Image of $w$ lies in the unit sphere $G_1$.

---

## 4. Part 2: Causal Continuity and Loop-Space Connectivity

### 4.1 Single-event deformation

Single-event deformation changes one loop event across an adjacent history while preserving loop closure.

### 4.2 Causal continuity

**Postulate CC.**
$$|w(\gamma') - w(\gamma)| \leq C \cdot d(\gamma, \gamma').$$

This remains an explicit postulate.

### 4.3 Causal simple-connectedness and Theorem 4.4

**Definition 4.2 (CSS).** No event-free bounded causal void induces non-contractible loop sectors at the relevant scale.

**Lemma 4.3 — ⚠️ Conditional (Assumption A\_dens).**
Observer-class cause-plexes with $\rho_{\mathrm{ac}}>0$ are CSS at scales $\ell\ge \ell_{\mathrm{ac}}$, **assuming**:

**Assumption A\_dens (event-density bridge).** Positive auto-causal density implies non-empty interior event support in every bounded loop-enclosed region at scales $\ell\ge \ell_{\mathrm{ac}}$.

Under A\_dens, the standard three-step argument gives CSS. $\square$

---

**Lemma 4.3a (A\_dens characterization) — ⚠️ Conditional (Homogeneity condition H).**

*Statement.* Let $\mathcal{C}^*$ be an observer-class cause-plex with $\rho_{\mathrm{ac}} > 0$. Suppose:

**Condition H (Observer-class spatial homogeneity).** Positive auto-causal density is spatially uniform at scales $\ell \ge \ell_{\mathrm{ac}}$: for every bounded region $\mathcal{V}$ with diameter $\ge \ell_{\mathrm{ac}}$, $\rho_{\mathrm{ac}}$ restricted to $\mathcal{V}$ is positive.

Under Condition H, every bounded loop-enclosed region at scales $\ge \ell_{\mathrm{ac}}$ contains at least one causal event, establishing A\_dens.

*Proof sketch.* Let $\mathcal{V}$ be a bounded loop-enclosed region with diameter $\ge \ell_{\mathrm{ac}}$. By Condition H, $\rho_{\mathrm{ac}}|_\mathcal{V} > 0$, so at least one stable recurring loop has support in $\mathcal{V}$. By Definition 2.10 and Definition 2.1, such a loop consists of causal events (state couplets). Hence $\mathcal{V}$ contains at least one causal event. $\square$

*Assessment.* The proposed derivation of A\_dens from $\rho_{\mathrm{ac}} > 0$ alone — via Definition 2.1 + CD — contains a gap. The CD axiom constrains causally related events but does not enforce event distribution across regions spacelike-separated from active loops. Global density $> 0$ does not imply local support everywhere. Condition H makes this bridge explicit. It is physically motivated (translation invariance / cosmological principle in observer-class regimes) but is an additional condition, not a consequence of existing primitives.

**Lemma 4.3b (A\_rich characterization) — ⚠️ Conditional (Definition 2.3 + consistency condition C).**

*Statement.* Let $\mathcal{C}^*$ be a cause-plex with $\rho_{\mathrm{ac}} > 0$ and let $(a,b)$ be a covering relation in some $\mathcal{C}_\alpha \in \mathcal{C}^*$. Suppose $c$ is an event with $a \prec c \prec b$ in some history $\mathcal{C}_\delta \in \mathcal{C}^*$ (guaranteed by CSS / Lemma L1). Suppose further:

**Condition C ($\mathcal{S}_0$-consistency of local insertion).** Adding $c$ with relations $(a,c)$ and $(c,b)$ to $\mathcal{C}_\alpha$ produces a locally finite strict partial order consistent with $\mathcal{S}_0$. Equivalently: $c \not\prec_\alpha a$ (no reverse order) and the insertion does not violate any global constraint from the initial state.

Under Condition C, A\_rich holds: there exists a finite adjacent-history sequence in $\mathcal{B}$ realizing the local insertion.

*Proof.* Construct the sequence explicitly:

**Step 1.** Form $\mathcal{C}^{(1)}$ by adding covering relation $(a, c)$ to $\mathcal{C}_\alpha$. Since $c$ is new to $\mathcal{C}_\alpha$ (or lacks this order relation), $c \not\prec_\alpha a$, so no cycle is created; the resulting structure is a locally finite strict partial order. By Definition 2.3, $\mathcal{C}^{(1)} \in \mathcal{C}^*$. By Definition 2.4, $\mathcal{C}_\alpha$ and $\mathcal{C}^{(1)}$ are adjacent in $\mathcal{B}$ (differ by one covering relation). Existing loop validity is preserved by Lemma R (monotonicity).

**Step 2.** Form $\mathcal{C}^{(2)}$ by adding covering relation $(c, b)$ to $\mathcal{C}^{(1)}$. Acyclicity check: suppose $b \prec_{\mathcal{C}^{(1)}} c$; then since $a \prec c$ (from Step 1) we get $a \prec c \prec^+ b \prec c$, contradicting strict partial order. So $b \not\prec_{\mathcal{C}^{(1)}} c$; the addition is valid. By Definition 2.3, $\mathcal{C}^{(2)} \in \mathcal{C}^*$; by Definition 2.4, adjacent to $\mathcal{C}^{(1)}$. In $\mathcal{C}^{(2)}$, the relation $a \prec c \prec b$ holds, and the original covering $(a,b)$ is no longer a covering (since $c$ is now strictly between them).

The two-step sequence $\mathcal{C}_\alpha \to \mathcal{C}^{(1)} \to \mathcal{C}^{(2)}$ realises the local insertion via adjacent-history moves in $\mathcal{B}$, establishing A\_rich under Condition C. $\square$

*Assessment.* The proposed derivation of A\_rich from Definition 2.3 alone is substantially correct but requires Condition C to close. For observer-class cause-plexes with $\rho_{\mathrm{ac}} > 0$, Condition C is physically well-motivated: the active local structure that generates stable loops near $(a,b)$ implies that local event insertions do not violate $\mathcal{S}_0$-consistency. The key improvement over the current paper state is that A\_rich is no longer opaque — it has an explicit two-step construction, and the only remaining condition (C) is precisely named. This is a genuine reduction in assumption complexity: from "it exists somehow" to "it follows from these two definitions plus this one named consistency condition."

**Theorem 4.4 (Restricted loop-space connectivity for CSS cause-plexes) — ⚠️ Conditional (H + C).**
If $\mathcal{C}^*$ is CSS, then $\Omega(\mathcal{C}^*, e_*)$ is connected under single-event deformations, **assuming**:

- **A\_dens** (above), and
- **A\_rich (multiway richness realizability):** whenever a compatible intermediate event is required by a local reroute, there exists an adjacent-history realization sequence in $\mathcal{C}^*$ preserving strict partial-order consistency with $\mathcal{S}_0$.

#### 4.3.1 Step 1: History-space connectivity — ✅ Proved
For finite comparable histories, Hasse-diagram relation edits connect any two histories by finite adjacent moves.

#### 4.3.2 Step 2: Loop tracking under non-critical edits — ✅ Proved
If edited segment is non-critical, closure persists.

#### 4.3.3 Step 3: Critical-events rerouting (flattened)

**Lemma L1 (intermediate event exists) — ⚠️ Conditional (H + C).**
Given covering relation $(a,b)$ used critically in a loop, there exists $c$ and history $\mathcal{C}_\delta$ with
$$a \prec_\delta c \prec_\delta b.$$

**Lemma L2 (incorporation of $c$ via adjacent transitions) — ⚠️ Conditional (C).**
There is a finite sequence of single-relation additions yielding a history where $a\prec c\prec b$, preserving prior loop validity (monotonicity under relation addition).

**Lemma R (monotonicity) — ✅ Proved.**
Adding a covering relation and reclosing transitively never removes existing order pairs; thus existing loop steps remain valid.

**Lemma L3 (replacement/reroute) — ⚠️ Conditional (C).**
In the enriched history, replace critical segment through one of two cases:

- Case 1 direct: $c\prec e_{k+1}$, immediate single-event replacement.
- Case 2 extension: add $(c,e_{k+1})$ in an adjacent history if cycle-free; global consistency checked by irreflexivity contradiction.

If $e_{k+1}\prec^* c$ then with $c\prec b\prec e_{k+1}$ one gets $c\prec^* c$, impossible in strict partial order.

**General case (multiple critical events) — ⚠️ Conditional (C).**
Sequential rerouting terminates in locally finite posets (Noetherian descent on interval complexity).

Hence Step 3 is established under A\_rich, completing Theorem 4.4 under stated assumptions. $\square$

---

**Proposition 4.5 — ✅ Proved.** Non-critical deformations preserve closure.

**Proposition 4.6 — ⚠️ Conditional (Theorem 4.4 + CC).** Image $w(\Omega)$ is connected in $G_1$.

**Corollary 4.7 — ⚠️ Conditional.** $w(\Omega)$ generates a connected subgroup of $G_1$.

## 5. Part 3: Minimality Forces $G = \mathrm{U}(1)$

### 5.0 Route C: Fixed-Point of Recursive Self-Description (Independent Route — ✅ Conditional)

This section develops a third, independent route to $G = \mathrm{U}(1)$, not relying on A\_rich or Postulate R. It derives U(1) as the unique fixed point of recursive self-description in the multiway cause-plex.

#### 5.0.1 The fixed-point framing

A cause-plex $\mathcal{C}^*$ is **recursively self-describing** if it contains observer-class entities that can represent the structure of $\mathcal{C}^*$ itself — including the amplitude group $G$. Self-consistency requires: the amplitude structure used to describe $G$ must itself have amplitude group $G$. When a cause-plex with amplitude group $G$ describes another with amplitude group $G$, the joint system has amplitude group $\Phi(G)$.

**Self-consistency condition:** $\Phi(G) = G$ — $G$ is a fixed point of $\Phi$.

#### 5.0.2 The self-description map $\Phi(G) = G \otimes G$

**Proposition 5.0.1 (PFT — Parallel Factorization Theorem) — ✅ Proved conditional on product initial state.**
*For systems $A \perp B$ (spacelike separated) with product initial state $\mathcal{S}_0 = \mathcal{S}_0^A \times \mathcal{S}_0^B$:*
$$w_{A \sqcup B}(\gamma_A, \gamma_B) = w_A(\gamma_A) \cdot w_B(\gamma_B)$$

*Proof.* A history $\mathcal{C}_\omega \in \mathcal{C}^*(\mathcal{S}_0^A \times \mathcal{S}_0^B)$ is consistent with the joint initial state iff it is independently consistent with $\mathcal{S}_0^A$ on $A$'s events and $\mathcal{S}_0^B$ on $B$'s events. Since $A \perp B$, there are no covering relations crossing the $A/B$ boundary, and the product initial state imposes no cross-constraints. Therefore $\{\omega : \gamma_A \cup \gamma_B \subset \mathcal{C}_\omega\} = \{\alpha : \gamma_A \subset \mathcal{C}_\alpha\} \times \{\beta : \gamma_B \subset \mathcal{C}_\beta\}$ — the history index sets are Cartesian-independent. The joint amplitude sum factorizes because P2 (spacelike events commute) and Def 2.8 (composition rule) give per-history factorization within each $\mathcal{C}_\alpha$, and the Cartesian index structure gives the full factorization. $\square$

*Remark.* PFT fails for entangled systems (non-product $\mathcal{S}_0$). This is correct: entanglement is precisely the presence of cross-terms in the joint amplitude arising from shared initial conditions. PFT applies exactly to the unentangled case.

**Corollary 5.0.2.** For product-state independent systems, the joint amplitude group is the tensor product $G_A \otimes G_B$. (Amplitudes are scalars in $\mathbb{C}$; the joint action $(g_A, g_B) \mapsto g_A \cdot g_B$ on a single complex number is the $\mathbb{Z}$-tensor product $G_A \otimes_\mathbb{Z} G_B$ in $\mathbf{Ab}$.)

Therefore: $\Phi(G) = G \otimes G$ and the self-consistency condition is $G \otimes G \cong G$.

#### 5.0.3 Fixed-point uniqueness

**Lemma 5.0.3 (No nonabelian fixed point) — ✅ Proved.**
*For any compact connected simple Lie group $G$ with $\dim G > 0$:*
$$\dim(G \otimes G) = 2\,\dim G \neq \dim G$$
*Therefore no nonabelian compact connected simple Lie group satisfies $G \otimes G \cong G$.*

*Proof.* For faithful finite-dimensional unitary rep $\rho$ of $G$, the Lie algebra of $\text{Im}(\rho \otimes \rho)$ has dimension $2\dim\mathfrak{g}$ (the two copies act independently on the tensor-product space, with at most finite center overlap). A fixed point requires $2\dim G = \dim G$, impossible for $\dim G > 0$. Concretely: $\dim G_2 = 14, F_4 = 52, E_6 = 78, E_7 = 133, E_8 = 248$, $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ has $\dim n^2-1$; all double under tensor product. $\square$

**Theorem 5.0.4 (U(1) as unique fixed point) — ✅ Proved.**
*The unique non-trivial connected compact Lie group satisfying $G \otimes G \cong G$ is $G = \mathrm{U}(1)$.*

*Proof.* Trivial fixed points: $\{1\}$ (dimension 0, no interference) and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ (disconnected, discrete — excluded by CC). By Lemma 5.0.3, all nonabelian groups fail. Among abelian connected compact Lie groups, only $\mathrm{U}(1)$ satisfies $G \otimes G \cong G$ (both sides are $S^1$; $e^{i\theta} \otimes e^{i\phi} = e^{i(\theta+\phi)}$ is again in $\mathrm{U}(1)$). All higher tori $\mathrm{U}(1)^k$ for $k \geq 2$ give $\mathrm{U}(1)^{k^2} \not\cong \mathrm{U}(1)^k$. $\square$

**Corollary 5.0.5 (Route C conclusion) — ✅ Conditional on PFT scope + CC + compact Lie regularity.**
*The amplitude group of a recursively self-describing multiway cause-plex with product-state composites and non-trivial continuous interference is $G = \mathrm{U}(1)$.*

*Honest condition set for Route C:* P1, P2, (L), Def 2.8, product initial state (scope condition), CC (continuity), compact Lie regularity. Does not require A\_rich, Postulate R, Aaronson, Baez, or local tomography as independent axioms.

---

### 5.1 Algebraic candidates

By Hurwitz's theorem (1898), the only normed division algebras are $\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C},\mathbb{H},\mathbb{O}$, giving unit spheres $S^0, S^1, S^3, S^7$ respectively. The amplitude group $G$ must be one of these unit spheres (or a subgroup thereof).

### 5.2 Postulate R: Representation Least Action

The physical principle of least action (PLA) — that among all causal paths, nature selects those near stationary action — is not a primitive postulate. It is *derived* from the path-integral structure: coherent sum over causal paths weighted by $e^{iS/\hbar}$, stationary-phase paths dominate, classical trajectory obeys $\delta S = 0$. PLA is thus a consequence of the amplitude group structure, not prior to it.

But the structural principle that *generates* PLA is prior:

> **Structural Principle S (Stationary Complexity).** Among all possibilities consistent with constraints, the realized structure is the one of minimal topological complexity. Equivalently: the selection principle extremizes complexity within the feasible set.

This principle operates in causal path space to give physical PLA. It is the same structural mechanism that, when applied to *representation space* — the space of possible amplitude groups — selects the amplitude group itself.

**Postulate R (Representation Least Action).** The same Structural Principle S that governs selection in causal path space governs selection in representation space. The realized amplitude group $G$ is the connected compact topological group of *minimal dimension* consistent with the physical constraints on closed-loop amplitudes.

The topological dimension $\dim(G)$ is the natural measure of complexity here: it counts the minimum number of independent continuous parameters needed to specify an element of $G$ — equivalently, the minimum number of real degrees of freedom per amplitude assignment. A group of lower dimension makes strictly fewer independent claims per causal loop.

**Remark (non-circularity).** Physical PLA is derived from the path integral with weight $e^{iS/\hbar}$, which already presupposes $G = \mathrm{U}(1)$. Postulate R selects $G = \mathrm{U}(1)$ from the structure of representation space via Structural Principle S, without using the path integral. The same underlying mechanism — stationary-complexity selection — operates at both levels. U(1) is the fixed point: it is selected by Postulate R and then generates, via the path integral, the physical PLA. This is a co-derivation, not a circular one.

**Remark (relation to prior elimination arguments).** The elimination of $\mathbb{H}$ via local tomography / tensor product constraints (Baez 2012, Aaronson 2004) and the elimination via Postulate R are independent routes to the same conclusion. The Postulate R route is more foundational: it does not depend on the connectedness machinery of Section 4 (Conjecture A\_rich), and it does not require importing facts about quantum information locality. It requires only Proposition 3.1 (stability $\Rightarrow$ $|w|=1$, i.e. $G$ compact) and the definition of non-trivial interference.

### 5.3 Elimination via Postulate R

**Constraints on G:**
1. $G$ compact — from Proposition 3.1 ($|w|=1$ for stable loops)
2. $G$ connected — required for non-trivially continuous interference (degenerate otherwise; see Remark 3.3)
3. $\dim(G) \geq 1$ — required for non-trivial (non-binary) interference; $\dim G = 0$ gives only discrete groups ($\{+1\}$, $\{±1\}$), producing no continuous phase variation between paths
4. $G$ is a Lie group with a composition law (Definition 2.8 requires group structure)

**Proposition 5.1 (Minimality selects U(1)) — ✅ Proved given Postulate R.**
*Under Postulate R and constraints 1–4, the unique realized amplitude group is $G = \mathrm{U}(1)$.*

*Proof.* By Hurwitz, the unit spheres of normed division algebras are $S^0$ ($\dim=0$), $S^1 = \mathrm{U}(1)$ ($\dim=1$), $S^3 \cong \mathrm{SU}(2)$ ($\dim=3$), $S^7$ ($\dim=7$, not a Lie group). Constraint 3 eliminates $S^0$. Constraint 4 eliminates $S^7$ (not a group under composition). Among remaining candidates $\{S^1, S^3\}$:
$$\dim(\mathrm{U}(1)) = 1 < \dim(\mathrm{SU}(2)) = 3$$
Postulate R selects the minimum: $G = \mathrm{U}(1)$. $\square$

**Corollary 5.2.** $w(\gamma) = e^{i\phi(\gamma)}$ for some real-valued $\phi: \Omega(\mathcal{C}^*, e_*) \to \mathbb{R}$.

*Proof.* $\mathrm{U}(1) = \{e^{i\phi} : \phi \in \mathbb{R}\}$. Any group homomorphism $w: \Omega \to \mathrm{U}(1)$ has this form. $\square$

### 5.4 Elimination (independent route: algebraic/structural)

The following independent elimination, relying on Section 4 connectivity and physical locality, corroborates Proposition 5.1 and provides additional constraint:

- $\mathbb{O}$ excluded: $S^7$ is not a Lie group (not closed under associative composition as required by Definition 2.8)
- $\mathbb{R}$ excluded: $S^0 = \{+1,-1\}$ is disconnected; under CC + A\_rich connectivity, the image $w(\Omega)$ must be a connected subgroup (Corollary 4.7), which $S^0$ is not
- $\mathbb{H}$ excluded (independent of Postulate R): local tomography and tensor product structure of the cause-plex require $f(n_A n_B) = f(n_A) f(n_B)$ where $f(n)$ counts real parameters for density matrices; quaternionic QM gives $f(n) = 2n^2 - n$, violating this (Aaronson 2004, Baez 2012)

Both routes converge on $G = \mathrm{U}(1)$.

**Theorem 5.3 (Main structural theorem — two routes).**
*$w(\gamma) = e^{i\phi(\gamma)}$, $\phi: \Omega(\mathcal{C}^*, e_*) \to \mathbb{R}$.*

- **Route A (Postulate R):** ✅ Proved given Postulate R + Proposition 3.1. Does not require A\_rich or locality/tomography.
- **Route B (Connectivity + Locality):** ⚠️ Conditional on CC + H + C (A\_rich) + locality/tomography premises. Independent of Postulate R.

The convergence of two independent routes strengthens the conclusion. $\square$

## 6. From $\mathrm{U}(1)$ to $e^{iS/\hbar}$

### 6.1 Layer separation

Event Layer: $w\in\mathrm{U}(1)$.
Observable Layer: identify phase with action ratio.

### 6.2 Additivity

**Proposition 6.1 — ✅ Proved.**
$$\phi(\gamma_1\cdot\gamma_2)=\phi(\gamma_1)+\phi(\gamma_2)\pmod{2\pi}.$$

### 6.3 Action identification

> ⚠️ **Circularity warning (see §6.5).** The definition below uses energy $\Delta E$, but energy is supposed to emerge from Noether's theorem applied to the cause-plex action. This section is an **Observable Layer bridge**, not an Event Layer derivation. The action $S[\gamma]$ is defined here *only after* assuming time-translation symmetry holds and energy is already a well-defined conserved quantity. It does not derive energy from the cause-plex; it names the phase in terms of pre-existing energy concepts.

$$S[\gamma] = \sum_{k=1}^n \Delta E(e_k) \cdot \tau_{e_k}, \qquad \phi(\gamma)=\frac{S[\gamma]}{\hbar}.$$

### 6.4 Identification statement

**Identification 6.2 — ⚠️ Conditional (Observable Layer structure assumptions).**
At Observable Layer (time-translation symmetry + Noether energy definitions in force),
$$\phi(\gamma) = \frac{S[\gamma]}{\hbar}, \quad \hbar = \Delta E_{\min}\cdot\tau_{\min} = \frac{\Delta E_{\min}}{|\mathcal{C}_{\text{ref}}|}.$$
This is a naming/bridge step, not a standalone microscopic derivation of specific system Lagrangians.

### 6.5 On the energy/action circularity

The derivation of $G = \mathrm{U}(1)$ in Sections 3–5 is **independent of the action definition** in §6.3. Routes A, B, and C establish the phase group from:
- Loop stability (Proposition 3.1: $|w|=1$)
- Compositional closure (Route C: $G \otimes G \cong G$)
- Postulate R (Route A: minimal dimension)
- Connectivity + tomography (Route B)

None of these use energy or action. The $\mathrm{U}(1)$ result is Event Layer.

Section 6.3 then asks: *given* that phases are $\mathrm{U}(1)$-valued, what physical quantity does the phase correspond to? The answer — action $S = \int L\,dt$ — requires Observable Layer machinery (Lagrangian, energy, time-translation symmetry). This is a **naming step**, not a derivation step. The circularity concern applies only if one claims to derive energy from the action while defining action in terms of energy. We do not make that claim here; we identify the phase with action after both are independently established at their respective layers.

**Open problem:** Define an Event Layer action functional $S_0[\gamma]$ in terms of cause-plex structure alone (event counts, partial-order depth, information-theoretic quantities) without using energy. Show that $S_0$ reduces to the physical action $S$ in the continuum/thermodynamic limit where time-translation symmetry holds. This would close the derivational gap.

The structural core remains strong: with continuity + connectivity + composition + locality/tomography constraints, U(1) is forced. But this document now explicitly separates what is proved outright from what depends on named assumptions.

---

## 9. Scope and Limitations

This is a structural-constraint paper, not a full predictive QFT derivation. It does not yet derive specific field content, couplings, or renormalization flow.

---

## 10. Conclusion

The prior optimistic claim that all open problems were resolved is not retained. The present consolidated statement is:

1. Unit-modulus loop amplitudes are proved.
2. Full unconstrained loop-space connectedness is false (counterexample).
3. Restricted CSS connectivity result supports the U(1) conclusion under explicit assumptions (A\_dens, A\_rich, CC, locality/tomography mapping).
4. Observable Layer phase-action identification is retained as conditional structural correspondence.

Accordingly, the strongest honest claim is **conditional structural derivation** of U(1), not unconditional completion.

## 11. Proof Notes and Residual Open Questions

### 11.1 Counterexample carried forward from proof-attempt

A causal-void annulus gives winding sectors that cannot be changed by finite single-event deformations. Therefore unrestricted Conjecture 4.2 is false in full generality.

### 11.2 Why restricted theorem is still useful

Physical use targets observer-class regimes; CSS is plausible there, but the bridge requires explicit assumptions (A\_dens).

### 11.3 Step 3 technical residue

The rerouting chain is operationally detailed, but realizability across all compatible histories is encoded as A\_rich and should be formalized as a theorem rather than left implicit.

### 11.4 Practical next proof targets

1. Formal theorem for A\_dens from existing epimechanics primitives.
2. Formal theorem for A\_rich using compatibility constraints from $\mathcal{S}_0$.
3. Constructive algorithm and complexity bounds for global reroute sequence length.
4. Explicit examples where assumptions hold and fail.
