## Potential State Space ($\mathcal{X}$)

The full potential causal reality — the territory. The space of all states a system could occupy, not just its current actuality. Exists independently of any observer or model. Not directly accessible; only representations of it can be constructed and manipulated. Defined in [Part 1: Generalized Mechanics](./01_generalized_mechanics.md).

## Representation ($X$)

A model of state — the map. Can model actual state, potential state, or any state. Can take many forms: a point estimate, a probability distribution, a partial observation, a compressed encoding, or any structure that carries information about state. Representations are themselves states: they must be instantiated in some physical substrate (neurons, silicon, ink) which has its own potential state space. Every representation is a state, but not every state is a representation. Defined in [Part 1: Generalized Mechanics](./01_generalized_mechanics.md).

## Representational Fidelity ($\mathcal{F}$)

How well a representation $X$ tracks a target state $x \in \mathcal{X}$: $\mathcal{F}(X, x) = 1 - d(X, x)$, where $d$ is an appropriate distance or divergence. When $X$ perfectly captures $x$, $\mathcal{F} \to 1$. When $X$ is maximally uninformative, $\mathcal{F} \to 0$. Predictive accuracy scales with fidelity given sufficient computation. Defined in [Part 1: Generalized Mechanics](./01_generalized_mechanics.md).

## Extant Representation

A representation that **remains in existence** in a given environment: its auto-causal loop clears that environment's thresholds, so its stability basin depth $\Delta V$ exceeds the perturbation $\Delta E$ the environment delivers. Extant-ness (survival) is the existence criterion that replaces value-laden talk of a "good" representation; it is measured as persistence ($\rho_{\text{ac}}$ under forcing), not graded against worth. The representations extant in an environment $\mathcal{E}$ form the **surviving set** $\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{E}) = \{X : \Delta V(X) > \Delta E_{\mathcal{E}}\}$, a viability set rather than a unique optimum. The **Representational Efficiency Conjecture** holds that members of $\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{E})$ are biased toward simple mechanical structure (maximal symmetry, sparse coupling tensor, minimal $\dim S$), because under a finite budget that efficiency is what funds the basin. The selection mechanism is the good regulator theorem (to persist is to model the environment) plus the thermodynamics of prediction (modeling it inefficiently wastes the budget). Efficiency is the selected-for trait, specifiable independently of survival; existence is the criterion. Developed in [Part 0: Prelude](./00_prelude.md) and [Part 5: Ontology and Open Questions](./05_ontology_and_open_questions.md).

## Surviving Set ($\mathcal{S}$)

The representations that remain extant in an environment $\mathcal{E}$: $\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{E}) = \{X \in \mathcal{R} : \Delta V(X) > \Delta E_{\mathcal{E}}\}$, those whose basin clears the environmental perturbation. The survival counterpart of $\operatorname{argmin}$: formally a viability kernel (Aubin, 1991), with the single cost-minimizer $X^*$ as its strong-selection limit ($\operatorname{argmin}_X C = \lim_{\Delta E \uparrow}\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{E})$ when basin depth anti-correlates with cost). Selection ranges over $\mathcal{S}$, not a unique optimum. See [Extant Representation](#extant-representation).

## Causor

A **causor** is *that-which-causes*: a higher-level causal mechanism/structure (often loop/operator-like) that produces state change. In Epimechanics, it is the functional middle term in the triad:

$$\text{Cause} \rightarrow \text{Causor} \rightarrow \text{Effect}$$

Note: scalar/model variables (e.g., basin depth, entropy production rate) are typically descriptors of causor structures, not causors themselves.

## Causal Operator

A **causal operator** is the formal mathematical representation of a causor, mapping cause-state to effect-state under specified conditions.

## Causal Density ($\rho_C$)

Effective causal pathway density at a chosen scale; informally, how many non-negligible causal routes are active per unit region.

## Labeling/Separability Quality (LSQ)

How cleanly observed states can be partitioned into distinct causal operator regimes. Higher LSQ generally improves predictability by reducing causal aliasing.

## Generalized Mass ($\mathcal{M}$)

Total causal content of an entity, defined as the integral of causal density over its region in state space.

## Auto-Causal Density ($\rho_{\text{ac}}$)

Density of self-sustaining causal loop structure; a loop-level emergent property, not a single-bond property.

## Stability Basin Depth ($\Delta V$)

Energy barrier between a current configuration and its nearest dissolution pathway.

## Repair Rate ($\dot{R}_{\text{repair}}$)

Rate at which degraded structure is restored.

## Internal Entropy Production ($\dot{S}_{\text{int}}$)

Rate at which disorder is produced inside an entity's structure.

## Maintenance Cost ($C_{\text{maint}}$)

Net structural degradation pressure, typically $\dot{S}_{\text{int}} - \dot{R}_{\text{repair}}$.

## Causal Event (*state couplet*, $e$)

The primitive of Epimechanics (Event Layer). A state transition $e: \mathcal{S}_i \to \mathcal{S}_j$ — one configuration follows from another. No physical content is assumed — no energy, no units, no conservation laws. Also called a *state couplet* to emphasize the pairing of input and output states. See [Part 0b: The Event Layer](./00b_event_layer.md) and [Cause-Plex and Spacetime](./causeplex_spacetime.md) §1.

## Cause-Plex ($\mathcal{C}$)

A locally finite strict partial order $(E, \prec)$ of causal events — the Event Layer structure from which spacetime, energy, and entities emerge. Each element $e \in E$ is a causal event; $\prec$ encodes causal precedence. Three properties (P1: partial order, P2: causal invariance, P3: finite latency) generate physics. See [Part 0b: The Event Layer](./00b_event_layer.md) and [Cause-Plex and Spacetime](./causeplex_spacetime.md) §1.

## Bond Operator ($b$)

A Structure Layer structural element: a recurring pattern of causal events connecting two regions of the cause-plex. Bonds carry state information between entities and ground the concept of interaction at the primitive level. See [Part 1.5: Causors](./01_5_causors.md).

## Loop Operator ($\mathcal{L}$)

A Structure Layer structural element: a closed recurring pattern of causal events — a causal loop that returns to its initial state. Auto-causal density $\rho_{\mathrm{ac}} > 0$ requires at least one stable loop operator. See [Part 1.5: Causors](./01_5_causors.md).

## Cause-Plex Index (CI)

A scalar measure of the loop composition richness of a cause-plex — how many topologically distinct loop structures it supports. Observer-class entities require $\mathrm{CI} > \mathrm{CI}_{\min}$, the threshold for topologically non-trivial loops (knot-type diversity, requiring $n_s \geq 3$ spatial dimensions). See [Cause-Plex and Spacetime](./causeplex_spacetime.md) §10.

## Causal Action ($A_{\text{causal}}$)

A measure of the total directed causal influence exerted by an entity across other entities over its lifetime. Related to the fitness×truth product in representational evolution. Introduced in [Part 1: Generalized Mechanics](./01_generalized_mechanics.md) §4b; developed formally in [Part 4: Time and Soul](./04_time_and_soul.md).

## Coupling Notation Reference

Epimechanics uses several coupling quantities for different purposes:

| Symbol | Name | Direction | Definition | Introduced |
|--------|------|-----------|------------|------------|
| $\kappa$ | Scalar coupling | Incoming | How strongly a field acts on an entity | Part 1 |
| $T^i{}_j$ | Coupling tensor | Incoming | Direction-dependent coupling between field and entity state components | Part 1 |
| $\kappa_{\text{sys}}$ | Systemic coupling | Inter-scale | $\partial \rho_{\text{ac}}^{\text{meta}} / \partial \rho_{\text{ac}}^{\text{sub}}$ — sub-entity's contribution to meta-entity persistence | Part 2 |
| $\Gamma_{ij}$ | Inter-substrate coupling | Inter-substrate | Coupling strength between substrates $i$ and $j$ of a meta-entity | Part 2 |
| $C_{\text{coupling}}$ | Outgoing causal power | Outgoing | Normalized capacity to influence others' states | Part 3 |
| $\mathbf{K}_{Ej}$ | Soul coupling tensor | Propagation | Maps entity $j$'s state deviation into representational space | Part 4 |
| $\kappa_b$ | Keystone index | Structural | $\Delta \rho_{\text{ac}} / \Delta \sigma_b$ — sensitivity of auto-causal density to bond strength | Part 2.5 |

$\kappa$ and $T^i{}_j$ describe incoming sensitivity (how forces affect the entity). $C_{\text{coupling}}$ describes outgoing power (how the entity affects others). $\Gamma$, $\kappa_{\text{sys}}$, and $\mathbf{K}$ describe inter-entity or inter-scale relationships. $\kappa_b$ is structural (bond criticality within an entity).

## Coupling Tensor ($T^i{}_j$)

A rank-2 tensor encoding how changes in the state of entity $j$ influence the state of entity $i$ across domain boundaries. The diagonal captures self-coupling; off-diagonal captures cross-domain coupling. Introduced in [Part 1: Generalized Mechanics](./01_generalized_mechanics.md).

## State Space ($S$)

The space of all possible values of the state variable $X$ for a given entity or system. The geometry of $S$ (metric, topology) determines what kinds of dynamics are possible. See [Part 1: Generalized Mechanics](./01_generalized_mechanics.md).

## Local Time ($T_{\text{local}}$)

The duration over which an entity maintains causal coherence — the integral of its causal presence over physical time. Zero at dissolution; potentially infinite for entities that become substrate-independent (encoded in culture, DNA, etc.). Defined in [Part 4: Time and Soul](./04_time_and_soul.md).

## Non-Local Time ($T_{\text{nonlocal}}$)

Total causal influence-time across all substrates an entity has affected — the integral of its representational footprint $R(E,t)$ over all time. The "how long does an entity matter" measure. Defined in [Part 4: Time and Soul](./04_time_and_soul.md).

## Agency ($A$)

The product of outgoing causal coupling strength, meta-representational weight, and consciousness: $A = C_{\text{coupling}} \times \mu_{\text{meta}} \times C_{\text{consciousness}}$. Multiplicative: zero in any factor yields zero agency. Defined in [Part 3: Intelligence, Consciousness, Agency](./03_intelligence_consciousness_agency.md).

## Soul ($\mathbf{R}(E,t)$)

The complete signed representational propagation function of an entity — a causal biography encoding how and where the entity's causal influence has propagated, weighted by sign (constructive/destructive) and magnitude. A formal renaming of non-local time extended to a vector quantity. Defined in [Part 4: Time and Soul](./04_time_and_soul.md).

## Self-Sufficiency ($\sigma$)

Fraction of minimum required causal power that internal loops can supply without external coupling: $\sigma = \mathcal{P}_{\text{internal}} / \mathcal{P}_{\min}$. $\sigma = 1$: fully self-sufficient. $\sigma > 1$: surplus (can export). $\sigma < 1$: dependent on external input. Defined in [Part 2.5: Entity Interaction](./02_5_entity_interaction.md).

## Attack Surface Density ($\rho_{\text{attack}}$)

Vulnerability measure: sum over accessible keystone bonds of their keystone index times the auto-causal density of their loop: $\rho_{\text{attack}}(\partial E) = \sum_{b \in \partial E} \kappa_b \cdot \rho_{\text{ac}}(\mathcal{L}_b)$. High when keystones are accessible and belong to high-$\rho_{\text{ac}}$ loops. Defined in [Part 2.5: Entity Interaction](./02_5_entity_interaction.md).

## Keystone Index ($\kappa_b$)

Sensitivity of auto-causal density to bond strength: $\kappa_b = \Delta \rho_{\text{ac}} / \Delta \sigma_b$. High $\kappa_b$ indicates a load-bearing bond whose degradation cascades through the entity's loop structure. Defined in [Part 2.5: Entity Interaction](./02_5_entity_interaction.md).

## Meta-Representation Weight ($\mu_{\text{meta}}$)

Degree to which an entity's model represents itself *as* a model — subject to error, revision, and incompleteness. $\mu_{\text{meta}} \in [0,1]$. Zero for transparent self-models (thermostats, simple organisms); approaching 1 for entities with well-developed meta-cognitive capacity. Required for full moral agency. Defined in [Part 3: Intelligence, Consciousness, Agency](./03_intelligence_consciousness_agency.md).

## Causal Power ($\mathcal{P}$)

Rate of work on state trajectories: $\mathcal{P} = dW/dt = \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{v}_X$. Units: energy per time. Outgoing causal power $\mathcal{P}_{E \to j}$ is the rate at which entity $E$'s actions do work on entity $j$'s state. Defined in [Part 2.5: Entity Interaction](./02_5_entity_interaction.md); used extensively in agency formula (Part 3).

## Q1–Q5 Structural Descriptors

Five continuous parameters characterizing any bond or loop composition:
- **Q1 (Energy mode):** kinetic ↔ potential — where received energy goes
- **Q2 (Output target):** state / bond / loop — what the output connects to  
- **Q3 (Topology):** open chain ↔ closed loop
- **Q4 (Leverage ratio Λ):** output event cluster size / input event cluster size
- **Q5 (Timescale):** bond latency relative to loop period (derived from Q1–Q4)

Defined in [Part 1.5: Causors](./01_5_causors.md).
